Present your final project in a 3-minute video. This video focuses on what can be achieved/discovered thanks to your visualization. You will submit your video to Brightspace.
Your presentation should contain (suggested times in brackets):
[~10s]
Project Name, student names, and the main idea for your project in one sentence (a tagline) [do not spend too much time here because this was already in your interim presentation].
[~15s]
Describe what the project is about, and the motivation(s) for the project.
[~20s]
Describe the data you used and your most important data questions (1 to 3 data questions).
[~20s]
Describe very briefly what is known already about this topic (e.g., related visualization projects, websites, articles).
[~30s]
Briefly introduce your visualization and how to read it, i.e. which visual marks and visual variables you are using to encode which dimensions of the data.

Data insights: focusing on your 1 to 3 most important data questions, show us how your visualization helps answer these questions. Talk us through the narrative and your process for figuring out answers (even partial) to these questions, demonstrating that these answers rely on the human being in the loop. This part is the core part of the presentation and you should maximize the use of images and videos (video captures of your system is a great way of showing animations and interactions for example).
If you are working in pair, only one of you needs to submit, this will be a group submission.
